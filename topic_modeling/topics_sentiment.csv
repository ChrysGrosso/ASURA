I havent personally had any crashes or instability issues thankfully, however, there are a blight of in-game bugs that completely ruin the experience.

Experienced Bug List - Sandbox Mode:

- Janitors priorities and pathing is just broken. There seems to be no prioritisation system and the pathing is just broken. Have a ride off track a little? Well, the janitors wont go over to that area, resulting in huge piles of sick and unemptied trash cans. Adding more janitors does not solve this issue. Only partial workaround is keep placing a staff building near the problem area and hope they will sort it out. Once sorted delete. Its broken and needs to be able to have a system that allows us to specify zones, or paths that janitors are responsible for.

- Rollercoasters have a huge issue where after a certain complexity, they just break and start failing in spectacular ways. The ride camera is also jittery and an absolute misery. 

- Guest AI just breaks after a while with guests not visiting areas of the park all of a sudden. Have a popular ride? Well, in a single heartbeat, it will go from being max capacity to not used at all causing huge profit issue for what was a stable park. 

- The visitor system is just broken too, you have to create parks that appeal to a demographic, however the moment you do, every other guest type gets angry and starts leaving the park. Its a stupid system and one that is incredibly difficult to manage around. It does not feel intuitive in any way.

- Money system is also ridiculous, why is everything so damn cheap? Purchasing a ride for $300 is just dumb and the money system need to be reworked entirely to make it feel more reasonable. A coaster should not cost 2k to build and land should not be 3k.

Overall, its a lovely game with huge issues. Give it a miss until the patches come in and then pickup once the tone on the game resolves itself. Such a disappointment form Limbic.";0.013505291005291013

It's got a lot of humor and entertaining components to it so it doesn't take itself too seriously, while at the same time having a reasonable bit of depth. But goodness is it buggy. As of the update from today (July 17, 2023). Tonight alone I've had issues where people are just gliding around, I moved a ride, but then later I couldn't move anything (the button was there, but did nothing). I had a ride elevated, and inclined ramps below it, and it placed the path fine, it worked, but under it you could see the texture of the path on the ground below it. Paths also tend to glitch and clip with the ground textures.

I'm pretty confident there's some pathing issues too. Both before and after the update today I've seen issues where people just won't go to a part of my park (specifically this is in Campaign 3). But then if I delete some of the path and rebuild it they'll use it all of sudden, with no obvious errors (and employees will still go there).

I've had other issues like not being able to delete stuff (same thing as the move, I could go into Delete mode, I could highlight stuff, but it wouldn't delete). I've had rides show 0 riders over the last X months and thus show no profit for a period of time, seemingly hurting my overall park finances and causing issues completing certain campaign goals. This and others would be fixed just be saving and reloading the save or just letting more time pass. Some of these I hadn't noticed again in my brief playtime today (a restart of Campaign 3) but it's clearly still buggy and I'm not sure if those specifically were resolved.

But that's all to say this earns a 3 out of 5 for me. It's buggy, but it is fun, and there is a lot of potential. I can't quite recommend it for myself and people that would be bothered by these bugs. All of the bugs mostly just add up and overall hurt my enjoyment of the game. Getting better for sure, and there's some clear attention to the game given the updates they've released so far, and I just hope that continues.";0.14778911564625843

Unplayable.......
I have tried to give the game patience and persevered through the launch and teething problems but after numerous patches, nothing has changed.
Because of AI issues my parks fail - I will get so far and my AI decide they no longer want to move and freeze in place causing an obstruction, therefore creating unhappy visitors and ratings.
None of my vendors or shops work fully, having same issue whereby the server just stands there doing nothing creating masses of queues therefore creating no profits and PS1000s in losses. 
Queues for rides also freeze leaving my rides 'abandoned' again, creating substantial money loss. 
some of the rides bug and don't even move!!! 
Once I imposify a roller-coaster - it doesn't unlock the relevant hooks to complete the tasks required to pass the level. 
and don't get me started on vanishing paths and scenery. 
If I could get a refund I would as I wont be playing the game again, well, because its broke!";-0.18

I'm a huge fan of park sims, and this has so much promise. But the glitches break gameplay, and the algorithm is impossible to understand. There are prefab coasters that just ... stop. Like they don't work (Merry-Goes-Around), and they're prefabs. Park appeal is necessary for leveling up, but you can't do it. Your park can be fully clean, your rides can rank high on fun, guest complaints can be minimal, but that rating will not rise. And that's not to mention that riding your rides is so glitched out that you can't possibly enjoy it. The coaster building could be fun if you could see any of your coaster's stats, but you can't. You just get ratings at the end with no explanation. Bad game. If they could fix the many, MANY issues, it would be fun. But I can't even get past the first level. The beginning of the game is hand-holding for all the wrong reasons. Nothing to help you understand the algorithm to have a successful park. I'm sad.;-0.012608695652173905

My issues are with the finances and A.I.; you can make the best roller coaster the world has ever seen yet no one wants to ride it and will only pay peanuts to ride it, the other is whenever you develop a new area everyone migrates to the new area and leaves other areas sparse. This results in you not wanting to build roller-coasters as they loose money, and not wanting to develop new areas as it deeply impacts your finances; though though very slow expansion this is possible.

It shouldn't have been released at all. It's fun and all but littered with bugs, including game breaking. 
First game breaking was a goal in scenario 2, goal to get 7 thrill rides, it stopped counting at 5 so couldn't complete. Well turns out it wasn't game breaking, it worked with a restart of the game. 
Second game breaking was a mission in scenario 3, you need to put two special ""hooks"" on two different roller coasters, the game does not recognize it, so I can't continue the scenario or any other scenario for that matter, since you need to complete all goals to beat a scenario, and you need to beat a scenario to be able to play next scenario. 

As I said, just don't buy this game. I'm embarrassed I paid money, full price money, to these creators.

Yikes! 

This game is fun but seriously unstable. Dealing with paths is a pretty dangerous game because the path might look functional but it could be totally broken (park guests won't use it, for example). Lots of complaints about long lines when queues aren't full, not being able to access rides with perfectly serviceable paths (at least in appearance). The game also crashes to desktop fairly regularly. It doesn't FEEL that buggy but then I know that it could shut off any time without me even realizing what is causing the problem and it sort of feels like you're rolling the dice when you're playing lol. IDK. Definitely seems like it could be cool when it's working. 

One of the better tutorials I've played in a game before, pretty comprehensive. I was really excited to play something less complicated than Planet Coaster but still fun. It can be that, I think. It felt like it, when it was running.";0.04099999999999998

It has so much charm its unreal.. even impossible...
The music is really sweet, the characters are great and the rides are fun and beautifully animated.

Yea, there are some bugs but tbh, I haven't found anything that I can't solve my remaking that coaster and I can forgive it its shortcomings because its really nice to see it all taking shape. 
It kinda reminds me of Nights in terms of the impossified rides (though probably not supposed to say that lol :P) .

The only thing I would say is that its hard to keep the park profitable in the campaign and you have to be pretty harsh turning off rides that don't bring people in. (only on the second campaign level so far).

Worth a go I'd say to make up your own mind but that's my 2c. :)

The positive reviews are just plain wrong. Either they haven't played the game enough to see the bugs (since the bugs seem mostly tied to how many people are in your park) or have the best luck ever. If you are wise, ignore the positive reviews. Even I had a positive review for a while because I hadn't played enough for the game to be straight up broken. From my tests, a lot of the bugs seem to come from customers being stuck inside rides or unable to make purchases. I had a few rides that no one would ride and when I looked at customers opinions it said ""Line is full moving on"" even though the line was empty. After deleting the ride suddenly a bunch of people magically appeared at the exit. In other instances people won't ride a ride unless you have the camera pointed at the ride. I noticed several times that customers off screen were locked in place not moving and once you point the camera at them for a second or two they start walking/buying/etc again.

Updated:

I'm taking back my previous review because I have encountered new game breaking bugs. If I quit playing and load a save I come back the park losing money for no reason. People stop riding rides that were previously full and stop visiting shops that had a line around the block. Also, there are a few flat rides that when you ""impossify"" them, people stop riding them. The Vortex Glider, Cowboy Hat ride, and the Pinball Bumper Cars all go in the negative when I ""impossify"" them. I have no idea why, they just do. Also, Roller Coasters are worthless! One second the line is full the next second nothing. You come back a few minutes later the line is full again? They go from making a lot of money to going deep in the red and back again for seemingly no reason what so ever. I want to love this game but the second I give the game a positive review it decides to prove me wrong and a bunch of new bugs surface. Wtf!?";-0.010832720738381115

there are bugs that make customers suddenly unable to reach rides, or they get stuck in one spot.

You have to close and reopen the ride to get it working for a little while again, but you'll probably have to do this again soon for all your rides.

 Notably the entrance and exit paths tend to bug out when you edit coasters, they are out of comission untill you get the money to build paths again.

I've been looking forward to it for months, and when it was released and was not in early development, I expected I was getting a completed game. I WAS NOT. This game has horrible clipping issues, people walking through objects, a crashing issue if you try to undo too quickly, and worst of all a near game breaking issue. I am on the fourth campaign mission of the game, and I had saved the game after completing the third goal. I had an income for the park of over 1,300 per month, and over 700 guests in the park. When I reloaded my game later, I had a bunch of guests coming into the park. But, when they reach the entrance, they turn around and leave. When I look at the reason, they say ""no rides."" I thought maybe this was a temporary thing as the level tries to get back to where it was guest count wise. But, I played the level for over an hour, and my guest count dropped by over 300, while I went from making 1,300 a month to negative 100 a month. No matter what I tried (adding rides, changing paths, etc) the guests would get to the gate and turn around to leave. I can understand if the game was in early access from a small studio having an issue like this, but from a big name company who is claiming that the game is complete, this is pathetic. 

I would recommend NOT buying this game until the developer makes serious improvements to it and delivers the completed game that we were supposedly getting. If they do not fix these issues and polish the early access game that they sold, I can say this will be the last time that I buy one of their games when it releases. I will wait several months at least to ensure the game actually works before buying it in the future. Incredibly disappointing.";-0.22875000000000006

The Good:  Art style is top notch.  Some interest ideas for rides.  Just not enough of them.  It IS Fun, when it works.  Its more accessible than Planet Coaster.  (Park Beyond would be HeroClix to Planet Coaster's War40k.)

Positives
----------
- Good looking game.
- story in campaign is decent 7/10
- I like that it gives choices in campaign before you start on what your objectives will be.
- Games flexible on how you build your rollercoasters. Building though is more unrealistic and fantasy.

Cons
--------------
- Bugs bugs bugs - Game does seen to crash on larger parks. Not good.
- landscape can be buggy and not show up competed. Paths still works but looks sloppy.
- Game doesn't have much theme park thought. Example ... I created a park where the rides were free and you only pay an entrance fee. Doesn't work and won't allow you do this without going broke. 
- Some of the campaign objectives are buggy and don't work correctly.
- the AI pathing is really bad. Customer will refuse to use some paths making rides/shops never have customers. Cleaners will ignore trash and path across the whole park to a trash can across the map.

Overall they got some work to do. Few simple fixes and this game would be decent enough to give a positive review. In the mean time i'm still enjoying it and playing it so take that for whatever that means. Maybe I like being tortured.";-0.02706980519480519

Once those are fixed I'll update my review but until then its been a complete waste of money.;-0.037500000000000006

I also find that costers are not making any money , I have played around with different set ups and used some blue prints but they seem to drop off and have no visitors, maybe a balancing issue of sorts? It's not very well explained how to set up a profitable coster witch is a shame as that is one of the main aspects I was looking forward to. 

On another note the customer needs seem to be quite horrendous,  they can't seem to walk too far without needing food/drink/toilet/sit down, this brings up a bit of a strange dynamic as I have more profit from shops than I do rides witch seems wrong to me.

But with all that said I am enjoying the game overall, I am enjoying the missions and the diffent challenges and I like the upgrades that you can do to the rides, I hope they bring more out as I can see it becoming repetitive when you start building the big parks";0.08192450824029772

The game has so many bugs it's ridiculous. You literally cannot complete the second mission of the campaign. There seems to be no official support or bug reporting system. The game itself doesn't really have any features that make it worthwhile or unique from other theme park games. It's unplayable in the current state and shouldn't have been released. 

The controls make the game unnecessarily difficult. Tracks constantly move in random directions when placing. Objects can be placed through other objects and terrain. When clicking on a shop it opens an object group instead of the shop information page, so you can't access it's menu. There is no consistency to game mechanics. Visitors randomly start leaving or rides become unprofitable for no reason. You cannot see tracks when you place them underground. Rides randomly freeze halfway round with guests stuck on them.

It's a mixed bag at the moment.  I'm currently about two scenarios short of finishing the campaign.  I must say the campaign's structure and challenges are pretty fun!  They aren't difficult by any means, but I love that it gives a bit of a challenge.  The downside is that I am almost done with them, and the only thing left is sandbox mode; which I somewhat have no desire to play due to the lack of coasters and flat rides.

Not only is there a lack of rides, but this game has tons of visual glitches and bugs.  The paths and rides easily collide with the terrain and look silly.  Guests get stuck in the queue for rides without boarding, even though the ride is operating.  Some of the challenges within the scenarios do not trigger when you complete them.  For example, there is a challenge on the island scenario where you have to delete the trees on one of the islands; but it does not trigger that you have completed it, even after all of the trees are deleted.  

The game has also crashed on me twice for no reason at all.  Luckily the game auto saves every five minutes and I didn't lose much progress, but it was very annoying.  Overall, the game looks great.  The rides, especially after impossification, are actually really cool.   I just feel that the game, in its current state, is overpriced and definitely needed more development time prior to release.  Hopefully they can fix the issues, but as of now I cannot recommend it.";-0.005952380952380956

The Good: This game checks all the boxes for me. It's got a fantastic and addicting story, incredible art direction and it's goal to allow total creativity is just about achieved. I keep finding myself wanting to create and better myself with each hour I play. Enjoyment 10/10, Strategy 8/10. 

The Bad: Mechanical issues when coaster building, cosmetic overlapping with terrain and builds, buggy paths every so often; The unfortunate thing is that these bugs aren't huge... until you grow your park to 1,000 people. This is where things become game breaking and will end up sabotaging your park. The coaster construction is almost there until you run into pieces not fitting into each other as they should be and some of mechanics not working as intended. aside from sandbox late game bugs, its really just annoying. I've read some other comments in regards to the coaster physics being slightly off and a number of other small bugs. No harm in waiting for them to be ironed out before buying I even encourage holding off. but if you just can't wait and want to dive in, I can tell you you won't be disappointed.

Conclusion: You can tell the devs put their tiiimeee into making this game. It's got a life to it and for me, that far surpasses the small inconveniences that pop up every now and again. however, this game needs immediate attention for it to have any longevity. Here's to hoping the devs are staying active on getting fixes out.

Reminds me of the Roller Coaster Tycoon (1) day's. Just corky and fun. 

Easy thumbs up, if the below bug is fixed soon.

Right now it is plagued with some near game breaking bugs. The biggest one, is guests/ai have issues pathing towards their interests. Meaning they are rarely happy, to the extent they would be if they could walk to where they want to be. As such, guests often leave not happy, which makes going bankrupt far more likely. This makes doing simple campaign missions far more difficult to complete, or very tedious, as it takes far longer to complete simple goals. 

Also they need to fix the pathways themselves. It's pretty awful to make paths look nice, and near impossible to make them run beside each other. Literally Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 was better, and that was a Cereal Box Game. (that was $4.99, and we got food with it too.)

If the Paths were fixed(both for guests to walk, and placement), easily becomes a great game. I assume they will fix it soon. If not this is going to a thumbs down, as it's a bug that actually make progression in the Campaign near impossible.

Nothing that I've read in the reviews, was actually true of my personal experience.

1) ""This sucks compared to Planet Coaster!"" - As someone with over 200 hours on Planet Coaster, I can tell you with complete confidence, that there are MANY shared aspects that will make you feel at home. The application of ""entertainers"" to keep your guests happy, the pathfinding, the path making, the coaster building, the theme scenery and general assembly of structures and themes... All of it felt so familiar and natural, that I'm left completely lost as to why people love to say this game is a dumpsterfire by comparison. It's not... It's not AT ALL.

2) ""There's glitches GALORE! EWW!"" - In my experience, absolutely not. While there are tiny nitpicks, as one can say for most games, I experienced no ""game breaking"" or otherwise ""unplayable"" glitches as MANY of the reviews suggest. I have no idea what they were doing wrong.

3) ""There's a shortage of content!"" - There's so much storyline, content, maps an possibilities that I'm once again befuddled to come to a reasonable explanation as to how people reach this conclusion. It completely contradicts my experience, and I don't feel like I've played as much as other reviewers might have... There's a pretty consistent storyline, there's a lot of fresh takes that weren't done on competing ""roller coaster"" simulators of the sort, and generally I just found most everything to be rather familiar and expected from one of the larger studios...

Which brings me to my next point...

4) ""This is literally robbery, and I will sue for the price you charge for this game"" - Seriously, no idea what they're talking about. In the limited amount of time, I've had three different characters developed, all with reasonable-enough models and rather pleasant voicework explaining a storyline that has been consistent through three different stages of the main campaign, leading me to really question what game the other reviewers even had played considering the unmistakable contrast to my own experience.

tl;dr My experience was great, I have no idea why this is only receiving a 50/50 approval rate. I'd recommend it, with 200+ hours in similar roller coaster sims.

First, this is the first park builder that feels like a successor to Rollercoaster Tycoon, the management and building all were very easy to pick up (because I loved the Rollercoaster Tycoon franchise).

Second, while buggy, it trust that in time that will all be worked out - don't let some of the visuals being off or weird functions set you off, with work they'll be able to smooth everything out.

What does it need though?
1. A smoother financial menu, I don't like the lay out of the current one with rides/shops scrolling. I would prefer small cute icons and it being in list format for profit/loss and actuals without needing to click around
2. Transportation rides are must. This game doesn't yet have them but again, I believe in time this will fully meet my expectations. I need to be able to move my guests around to specific areas
3. Which brings me to three, not a huge fan of the property expansion.Honestly don't know how to make it better, but maybe it's just the maps. I loved in Roller Coaster Tycoon where there'd be like huge gulfs/cliffs/plateaus that I would need to build up to or around (thus the need for transportation rides). This feels flat-ish geography wise

Overall though, it's a buy but just be patient. I think it's a fantastic game with huge potential and look forward to seeing where they take it - so much so that I bought the Annual Pass too.

The game has some bugs that are being ironed out by the development team, most bugs so far have been campaign oriented than sandbox.  Also, It still requires some balancing and fine tuning, which will be coming with future updates. 

Other than that , it's an awesome game with huge potential that I feel has been judged a bit too harshly by other players. 

I come from many hours of PlanCo and PlanZoo , Park Beyond scratches the same itch and is visually very pleasing.  I love that in comparison to the Planet games, you can scale scenery items, which makes it very convenient to add further variety by playing with size as well as rotation, and also makes you wonder why nobody thought to implement it in planet games.

Building coasters in this game is much easier and probably more fun than the more realistic approach , but that depends on the player I guess. 

Really looking forward to more content. You can see that the game is a product of love and I believe the dev team will not disappoint.

This game is not a stable release, do not buy.

I already expect that I'm going to put a lot of hours into this game, and at the same time I'm recommending against it in its current state, at its current price. This should, at best, be considered Early Access. The ride camera has clipping issues with the cars for the rollercoaster you are using, the placement of the track is finicky and has on multiple occasions either put the track in a completely different location or angle than the chosen spot, and the significant change in ride dimensions from impossification means that it's very difficult to determine where, precisely, the boundaries are for where you can and cannot place track around them. And I have had roller coasters simply never leave the station while operating after running perfectly fine for an extended period of time, despite being in full repair.

The campaign has multiple segments that either don't explain something, or only explain it well after the point where it would have been useful to know. The dialog aims for charming and misses the mark by a not insignificant margin, and the vaguely first-person camera used in the tutorial is directly unsettling. Models and animations used in cutscenes are lower quality than I would expect from a game of this price.

Many aspects lack any real variety of control. The only changes you can make to most flat rides are coloration, price, and impossification.

Now, if ALL OF THAT hasn't turned you away? You may like this game. As I said above, I'm GOING to play more of it. The madness coasters you can design are genuinely a delight, when they actually work, and the concept of impossification has deep appeal. If you're reading this, and the price has dropped to $30 or below? Go for it. Have fun. I hope that whatever DLC they have going actually adds mechanical depth, rather than just being a pack or three of assets they couldn't finish in time for release. I'd hope that mechanical depth just gets patched in over time, but calling this good for release as-is tells me they aren't likely to do that.";0.0787467700258398

I am actually really enjoying, and I hope I'll be playing this game for years, but right now it is entirely unplayable.

But eventually, you'll come across one that you can't work around and you're dead in the water. 

I'm sure this will all be fixed, and features will be added, but how long do I have to wait? 

Some other negatives: 
- You can't have multiple roller coaster trains on the same track. 
- The parks are large, and detailed, but there are no monorails, trains, or any way to easily get people across the park? 
- Only three types of coasters available. 
- The campaign is broken, which is what you use to really learn the game.

There are a lot of QoL- & basic features missing, for example: workzones (to organize staff into different areas); workteams (to organize workers into groups that share the same jobs); staff ways (only usable by staff); pathway update (change texture and railing after building) and so on and so on.

I wouldn't buy the game at full price at this point. It's fun, however if you are a veteran theme park sim or management sims in general you are gonna notice an unfortunate lack of common quality of life features that you are used to. Things like being able to update an existing path's texture and fencing. A lot of the other features feel clunky as well. Trying to rotate things while they randomly snap to who knows what is infuriating and I can't figure out how to turn it off.

Also, a lack of feedback on why rides are suddenly not making a profit. In the second campaign map I was doing really well until my rides randomly starting bleeding money and I have been spending hours just fiddling with prices and turning off rides and facilities and cutting staff pay just to stave off bankruptcy with barely any idea of how to fix it.

Overall, I like the less realistic take on the theme park genre and I like being able to make physics and safety defying rides but until there are noticeable improvements to the games base systems to include QoL features and a lot of bug fixes I would say only pick this up on sale or other discount.";-0.09351851851851853

As someone who bought this game to be played mainly on the Steam Deck, this game is an absolute blessing for someone like me who enjoys Sim/Tycoon games with a controller. The seamless Gamepad support is dope! Especially for those who prefer playing sim games on a console. And with the Steam Deck's customizable controls, the experience is poised to be even more remarkable!

Visually, the game boasts impressive graphics. I've had the pleasure of experimenting with different settings, combining Low, Medium, and High options to achieve a pleasant balance between aesthetics and performance. Playing at a solid 30-40FPS with my customized settings makes the game highly enjoyable. However, I must admit that zooming out completely causes some noticeable shadow pop-in, reminiscent of Jurassic World Evolution 2. While there were a few graphical glitches, they were minor and should be rectified in future updates.

When it comes to gameplay, I find it strikes a satisfying middle ground between the beloved Planet Coaster and Parkitect. You'll understand precisely what I mean once you dive into it. That being said, there is room for improvement, particularly in terms of object placement within the game world. A touch more polishing in this aspect would go a long way.

Now, the burning question: Is it worth the price? Personally, I believe a 25% reduction in price would be more appropriate, considering the existing bugs. Nevertheless, I have no regrets about purchasing it. This captivating business simulation game shows tremendous potential and what matters is it's a quality game that's fun to play!";0.13569767441860464

I've played Planet Coaster more hours than I care to admit and its a near perfect game. Park Beyond rivals it in some ways but there are things that Planet coaster does better.  There is also only three variants of roller coasters, and for a theme park game, that is abysmally low.

From the few hours I've played of Park Beyond its a solid game with good management game play. Better tools in this department compared to Planet Coaster. The heat maps help when deciding where to place shops and amenities. The Roller coaster building is pretty decent but lacks precision.

There are a few bugs, but I'm sure can be fixed with updates. one stand out bug that bothered me (possibly has already been patched out) is when you copy a building structure it doesn't do so and you have to quit out to the main menu and reload the save. This game is definitely not for accurate theme park builds, but of course your not getting into this game for that, however I do like that it can start out as a normal theme park and you have the option to ""impossify"" the rides and go as wacky as possible. 

When it comes to designing your park the main thing that bugs me is the lack of precision. there are tools that  does help with precision but they can be pretty finicky when trying to make buildings. its still usable, just need to get used them. I do like the fact you can scale objects, something  I hope the sequel to Planet Coaster implements.

Park Beyond is a great start and hopefully they'll add more to the game as time goes on.";0.125

My only gripe is in the Campaign. I'm on the 3rd map and it's quite challenging. I have a park capacity of 800, however I only have 400'ish guests. It wants me to build and open 7 unique flat rides, but I only have 6 unlocked. And my park appeal is very low despite my guest rating and cleanliness rating is very high. Also, visitor cohorts (teens, adults, etc.) are not interested in riding my coasters that apparently amaze the cohort, despite the price not being high.

Der Grafikstil ist quietschbunt, was mir ausgesprochen gut gefallt, und die Hintergrundmusik ist recht angenehm. Zudem hat man sehr viele Moglichkeiten, seinen Park nach seinen eigenen Vorstellungen zu gestalten. Ich personlich habe bisher sehr viel Spass beim Fuhren und Gestalten meines eigenen Parks. Leider gibt es noch ein paar unschone Bugs, die fur ein wenig Frust sorgen konnen, aber ich hoffe, dass diese bald behoben werden.

The existing management QoL, flat rides, pre-built modules for shops and coasters make this very accessible without overcomplicating for even new players to the genre who may not care for complicated systems.

8 Hour Review:

I love this game. I still haven't had any crashes or gamebreaking bugs - some of the minor issues I noticed disappeared with the recent patches.

There are many rides, considering both flatrides (25) and coasters can be impossified, meaning a new version of them exist, that leads to a considerable number of buildings for an initial release.

The QoL and management aspect was on point and entertaining - you can synchronize all shops of the same type so that the price will update automatically should you decide on any changes and then you control the flow of visitors/price among the various structures including toilets, shops, entrance and rides,  without too much hassle, this information and the control is provided to you with easy access.

Recommended.

3 Hour Review:
Not a fan of the genre, so I hadnt dipped my toes until this game whose theme really spoke to me - I started playing it today and perhaps the devs worked hard to patch in hotfixes, but the gameplay experience has been smooth, no crashes or gamebreaking bugs others described. 

Gameplay wise, I really like the rollercoaster customization and what its called flatrides, on mission 3 to unlock impossification and so far, it's been alot of fun.";0.1290757575757576

+ It reminds me of Thrillville with its [b]extrodinary rollercoaster parts and rides[/b].
+ I like the [b]gameplay loop of building excitement[/b] and using that to [b]upgrade your existing rides[/b] to become more spectectular!
+ I actually enjoy the [b]limited customisation[/b]. I felt overwhelmed when it came to this in Planet Coaster.
+ The [b]maps in the campaign[/b] are [b]fun to use[/b] for rollercoasters due to their [b]unique layouts[/b] and little bits and pieces.

- It [b]crashed twice[/b] on me so far, I play on Ultra with good specs.
- It's [b]not polished[/b] as far as it should. Examples: Hair clips through hats, paths clip through the ground, some visitors can walk into the air when you edit the path. I encountered some more issues like this.
- You [b]cannot edit a path[/b] to change the colour / rails after having placed them.
- You [b]cannot see how ""full"" your park is[/b] to avoid building too many attractions.
- You are [b]not told that you need to fulfill team goals to get 3 stars[/b] in the 3rd campaign and no team goals are generated after finishing the campaign in that level. This means you'll have to fully replay the campaign which is tedious.
- Lots of times I [b]had to micromanage things like food stalls, drinks and attractions[/b] due to the shift of where people would go after building a new attraction or due to certain events.

[h1]Overall opinion:[/h1]
So far I [b]really enjoy the game despite its flaws[/b]. I am a fan in general when it comes to games like this, and the [b]core gameplay loop is fun to use[/b] to upgrade not only attractions but staff and stalls too. I am sure that many of the issues I have described will be fixed eventually, I am hopeful.

First off just go play Planet Coaster. Yea they havent updated the game in a while but it is better than this ""new"" game. Oh and for those that are saying this is not much of a management game so it is fine for what it is. You havent played the campaign mode or play with money off, with everything unlocked.

Ill start with Pros (cause list is so much shorter)
* There is a game (cant believe that has to be said)
* The campaign mode is actually fun (for the most part)
     *With that theres choices that you can make that make the campaign a bit different.
*Impossifications: They are fun and whimsical. But will and do get stale after while so if you are playing for that just play sandbox and unlock all flatrides and shops and impssify everything. View it and then you have your ""game""

Cons:
*For those that play Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo you can stop complaining about their pathing because wooboy the pathing here is unbearable. Doesnt let you path in most places because of reasons ie. intersection, too narrow, no reason apparently. Oh and incline wtf - What happened to stairs - Apparently this game doesnt believe that stairs exist. 
*Your main attraction (the coasters) have 0 buzz better yet, the shops have more people showing up than the damn coasters (or flat rides) that are perfectly fine. 
* You cant make the entrance fees high and make the coasters 0 dollars. Yea they give you the option but then guests leave because prices are too high (8 dollar entrance fee)
* Clipping - Remember the paths? yea they clip weirdly like a mother trucker. Everything clips with everything, rides clip to building, foliage, the ground, benches,  
*Staff - they dont just plop into the world no they are like guests and walk in through the entrance. Boy when I worked for a themepark if I came in costume through the entrance my butt would have been handed to me. Not to mention you cant move them nope no pick up and deliver with them. Hell even Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 had that. Not to mention they arent intuitive - They dont do the nearest task (Janitors mainly) they choose to pick a random thing to do and go do it when theres trash or puke infront of them. Will the other Janitor do it? not that I know of because even after 20 min that trash is still there. With 14 Janitors.

Edited to take out that you can move around shops you have to leave the menu and click on the shop again.
All in all dont buy if you did return immediately wait for a sale when they sell a copy for 2 dollars or 1. If you bought it and you cant return im sorry. I am there with you. We wasted money.";-0.020446570972886765

For the former: Park Beyond's a way more whimsical game with some fun twists on its campaign mode (choices, more fleshed out characters--for a park tycoon, etc.). It doesn't have the (incredible, amazing) customizability as Planet Coaster, and some of the systems are significantly simplified, but the Impossification system really amps up the fun you can have with rides and coasters, and removes a lot of the more tedious micromanaging that Planet Coaster has. It's the version of a park sim you play when you want to be creative but not THAT creative, or you don't have the mental energy to invest in something more intense but still want to do the cool stuff.

For the people who didn't like Planet Coaster: this game is a much chiller version of park tycoon. It's a WAY easier entry point into modern park sims, with some of the same potential for depth. No need to build tons of scenery pieces and buildings, making coasters is way easier and more forgiving, and Park Beyond REALLY incentivizes you to do the fun stuff. No guests complaining that the coaster goes too fast! Want to launch people out of a rocket and into a stunt ramp? Go for it! In fact, make that park ride's animatronic Kraken sploosh people into a dunk tank for fun! Best of all, it won't take eight hours to build a coaster, building the whole thing only to realize somewhere in the middle you made the whole ride puke and you need to scrap the whole thing. 

Park Beyond is a fun, charming take on park management. It's good fun with great potential. The big caveat I have right now on launch is that there seems to be very bizarre bugs, though nothing game-ending. Sometimes paths won't place until you back out of the pathing menu and go back in. Sometimes you have to ""shut off"" and ""turn on"" a coaster after saving to get it going. One memorable bug made an entire section of my pathable park a No Man's Land where guests refused to go for some inexplicable reason. None of these broke the game, all were fixed either by reloading or moving something around (which, I think, is free of cost). I'd like to see them fix these bugs before I wholeheartedly recommended the game, but realistically building a game like this is a logistical nightmare so I'm honestly pretty OK with the state that it's in on launch. They should fix it, but realistically these ARE fixable bugs and don't really hinder enjoyment.";0.1960036945812808

I played the Beta 2 days before launch and enjoyed the campaign and learning the controls, I can see so much potential in this game. The 'finished' game feels slightly smoother for me compared to the Beta even though I'm running it on a below minimum gaming laptop.

It's Planet Coaster but it's not. This game feels much more 'fun' than Planet Coaster with it's bright colours and wacky rides. The impossification aspect is so bonkers, I love it. Yet to see if it becomes very build heavy as I'm only a short way into the campaign but I'm really enjoying it. 

Rollercoaster games are a big hit for me and this certainly ticks all my boxes. I do hope there will be more ride variety than Planet Coaster as that's fairly limited, I expect this will come in future DLC but so far so good. 

I pre-ordered the game outside of Steam at a slight discount because I thought the price was a little steep. I ordered the visioneer edition which had the ZOMBEYOND Impossification set and season pass which I believe will give me access to the 3 upcoming DLCs. 

I was able to access the sandbox after completing the first 2 campaigns (I didn't try before starting the campains) if you choose the option to have everything unlocked before loading your sandbox level you should be able to see the pre-order bonus PAC-MAN DLC is available in the game by looking in the research tab. I have yet to find where the season pass exclusive coaster car skins are located.

Wonder if they will develop a wacky zoo/aquarium game that could rival Planet Zoo. I'd love to see that! Anything zoo or sea-life related would be a big hit for me.";0.1267566782810685

Base game has 25 flat rides where as the Visioneer Edition adds an extra 3 flat rides (that was through pre-ordering, not sure if Pac Man and Zombie is still included in the Visioneer Edition after launch). There are 8 story campaign missions to complete and 27 sandbox mode maps to play on. Lots of scenery items, prefabs and the list goes on. A shout out and a huge compliment to the whole Park Beyond team, great game, just lovely. Can't wait to see what the future of Park Beyond holds through season passes and DLC content. Get this game, you just gotta do it. Love Park Beyond. Let's get building! 10/10 from me. IMPOSSIFICATION!!!

EDIT:

The game performance (for me personally) has greatly improved since playing both the closed and open beta. The impossifications are pretty cool, works for not just the rides but for staff members and shops too. I do have an issue though, is there a way to rename you're park when you save a game? It's really confusing having multiple parks without being able to name them. When I colour the supports on coasters, it doesn't change the colour, however, the track can change colour...otherwise, great game, 2 thumbs up from me. This, I must admit it now, this is my new favourite theme park game. Park Beyond is unique in every way and is different to other theme park simulation games. I love the idea of it, brilliant.

Sadly, the only way you can play it right now is to explicitly avoid using key game features, and then exploit to get past the broken mission challenges. I hadn't played a theme park builder in many years - there must be better ones out there. I'd look at those first.

In short, pick it up if it's on sale for US$15 or under, or wait for it to be fixed. We're only one patch in at the time of review (sad that this is a thing...), so it might be a while.

For those still interested and reading, here are some tips to get around some of the common bugs:
- Don't make branching or looping paths. Put everything along one snaking path, or try a hub and spoke layout if you're feeling daring.
- Don't have steep inclines/declines. People will jiggle at the edge until their happiness depletes, then leave.
- Have a bottle of bourbon ready if you're playing with a controller. Actually, have it anyway.
- Don't rely on roller coasters. You'll go broke. If you've got a lot of cash, you can build one to complete some mission challenges, but delete or disable it afterwards.
- Micromanage the prices of all the items. You can get around some of it with the ""sync"" option, but every price needs to be tuned for every building. Then repeat since it can change. This is the core game loop.
- If something is losing money after you've tuned the price, delete it.
- The campaign will try to trick you into spreading out your buildings. Don't fall for it. If a challenge requires it, build the building for the green check, then undo for a refund. Sadly, this doesn't work for roller coasters.
- Be careful of the height of your buildings (both on platforms and plateaus). They get expensive fast.
- Don't try to fix glitched looking paths. Just delete them and go a different way.
- If you use scenery, don't let it cover paths or connections. You never know what's going to break one, so you need to be able to see if anything's busted. I only used the bare modules (cubes) for buildings later on. Last tab on that build screen.
- Manually save often. Autosave works, but there aren't many slots (maybe I missed a setting?) and it can take several minutes for a subtle bug to be discovered and you'll be well on the way to failure by then.";-0.021530612244897968

Flat Rides and Coasters cant be boarded by visitors anymore, they glitch out on the entrance or exit and block the ride from continuing its opperation. 
The ""Impossification"" Feature seemed nice in the promotional Material but is just a simple upgrade to rides, you cant customize the ""Impossification"" which feels weird to me because in the trailer it looked like you could Impossify everything yourself. 
Designing a Coaster is also a nightmare from the usability. 
Once the Coaster gets a bit more complex with multiple inversions the tracks start to glitch causing extremly high g-forces where they should not be.
Accuratly placing tracks around objects, or even underground start to become extremly difficult. 
Once you want to try the ""Impossification"" Modules on a Coaster things really start to get fiddely to the point where a Coaster Design easily costs you multiple hours. 
The Coaster Stations cant be customized to fit the Theme of your Theme Park making them stick out like a sore thumb. For example: the Second Campaign Mission is Desert/Western themed and you can only choose Western Themed Flatrides and Standard looking Coasters. No Minecart Coaster Trains, no wooden Coaster, no Custom Theming to the coaster station. 
The Coaster really seem like an afterthought. 

TL;DR:
Overall this game seems very unfinished, handles like an early alpha build, suffers from performance issues and really Oversells on the Features and under delivers on them in the actual game.";0.0005729166666666643

- Some great Prefab coaster designs to help inspire personal creations
- Easy to use UI
- Fun soundtrack to listen to whilst playing
- The Impossification process is a fun little addition for upgrading rides and staff

Cons:
- A small selection of coasters, flat rides and shops at the moment. More needed to get this game to where it should be.
- A few game crashes have happened when testing roller-coasters
- Pathing can be janky at times, with right angles or smooth forks seemingly not working
- On-board ride view is a bit jerky, and the trains look blocky and unfinished, instead of the sleek look they have when viewing from off-ride.
- Precise placement of things like Entertainment Points can be very difficult, and often they snap to parts of paths that they shouldn't.";0.06876293995859213

It is not trying to give you all the tools to customize every single aspect of your park, and the game is playing on different sort of leverage to bring challenges and novelty, mainly using a quite interesting campaign and the impossification to get your park special. More accessible, maybe also offering less depth (and again definitly less customization), it's nonetheless a fun game.
A good exemple to illustrate that is the coaster ride music. There is only like 4 of them. My first reaction was bad. But then i realized that each music is changing dynamically according to the current state and speed of the rides, tailored to change the beats with the beat of the ride. I think it is a beautiful idea, and a nice change to the formula.
Impossification is also covering more than flat rides or coaster asset. I'll let you discover that but they went all the way through the concept.

Keep in mind that the mechanics of the games are also different. Wether it is a coaster or a flat ride, the cash (and the fun) you'll get from it are dependent from its stats. It's another way of playing it, be aware that it is not your common theme park tycoon game.

In terms of content, counting the 2 core elements i just mentioned, we are in the scope of Planet Coaster on release (less coaster, but more flat rides. PC at release was really empty on this aspect too, it came with update then DLCs).

Graphism are not ugly, but honestly it's quite simplistic and definitly had to be done according to a relatively humble budget. 

Bugs are presents, but so far i haven't met anything blocking (soft or hard) nor really annoying.

I think the game could use a few QoL improvments, and definitly needs to do something about its pathing system which doesn't work so well. The coaster building requires some getting used to but i find it in the end better (yes, i said it) than PC's one.

Overall i think this game is quite enjoyable and worth a purchase, altho waiting for a few patch can not hurt.  The roadmap include free contents (with free coasters and rides) which is nice, and i believe that if you take this game as it is, and not as a direct rival of Planet Coaster, you won't be disappointed.";0.055753968253968264

There were a lot of bugs in the beta. There are still bugs in the full release, sometimes leading to crashes. Luckily they don't happen to often (at least for me), and with the 5 minute auto save you're pretty safe.

About the game - a really great, fresh take on the genre. If you wanted Planet Coaster to have more sim/manager features, this is your game. You can design some really great parks, really crazy (although unrealistic) roller coasters. There aren't as many rides and props in here as in Planet Coaster, but the developers said they will add more in the future.

The campaign is fun and challenging, although personally I don't care too much about the different characters. You can finish the missions in quite different styles, some are probably way more difficult. The sandbox mode offers quite a few options and different maps so I think there is great replay potential.

[b]For those who've seen all the negative reviews, I'd like to clear a few things up, before I start my personal review. 
First of all, this game is well-optimized and barely contains noticeable, let alone ""gamebreaking"" bugs or even crashes. Minor issues always occur at launch, even with triple A-titles, and these will be ironed out soon enough.
Secondly, there's a quicksave feature available and switched on at default.
Thirdly,  don't just look a the amount of negative reviews. Most people who enjoy the game don't bother to write a positive review and the vast majority of negative reviews contains false claims and/or exaggerate.[/b]

On to my personal review then!

It's been decades since the release of the classic titles Rollercoaster Tycoon 1, 2 and 3, yet this game has overhauled the genre entirely and brought it back to life. The vibrant, whimsical, eye-pleasing and over-the-top nature of this game leaves little to be desired and should be good for hours of good old fun. 
Especially the coaster builder is top-notch and well-designed with smooth curves, inversions and wacky imaginary elements to be added. The so-called ""hooks"" which can be selected, allow for a vast array of different coasters to be constructed, from mild junior coasters fit for families to extreme thrill rides to scream your heart out. 
On top of that, the Impossification option within the game is the best choice the developers could have made. The game offers 25 different flat rides, yet all of these can be ""Impossified"" and redesigned into [u]at least[/u] one other version. Some of these even have up to three different versions, which brings the total amount of rides somehwere close to a whopping 60! The Impossification even works on all food and drink stalls and staff members, to add to the goofiness.

Of course it's hard to overlook another contestant within this gaming niche from October 2016, in the name of Planet Coaster. Although this older title offers more content as of date, that's largely due to the steady release of paid expansions and other DLC. The base game as it stood at the release date, doesn't even hold a candle to Park Beyond. Both the coaster and path constructing tools were tedious at best and the selection of flat rides wasn't really something to write home about either. This game might offer more to those who solely want to focus on decoration, but that's not what this sort of management and simulation titles should be all about. In fact, don't we all just love to build a theme park and focus on our imagination, even torment the guests a little from time to time? That's what Park Beyond is all about!

Park Beyond may just become game of the year to me, as a true sequel to the good old games we all cherish in our hearts. Limbic Entertainment, known for developing another great game Tropico 6, have done a good job on this game and according to their roadmap for the nearby future, there's a lot more to come! I truly can't wait to see where Park Beyond will go next.

Things like placing paths and precise tools for rotating and moving objects etc. feel very clunky and frustrating and are done better in other games in this genre. 

It feels like a remake of Planet Coaster with less content and more bugs right now. The roller coaster designing and building stands out from others in the genre so if you're really into that specifically it could be worthwhile, otherwise I would hold off for some patches and maybe extra content.

Also what i played fom the ""Story"", this is so much better then any of the modern park builder, the personalisation of the goals and the goal setting for each coaster are great. They actual have a meaning and you will try and think of ways to realise them - like let the coaster at least last 3 minutes or reach 120 km/h or dont reach 80 and so on. Cool way to influence the Visitor Groups.

Imposifications are fun and Game fells very intuitive and easy to get into.

There are Bugs, but i dont have something major, just 2 small and there are some things with clippig. But when i look at the hystory of the Dev im sure it gets fixed.

And yes, the content is on the lighter side, BUT if you count the hole imposifications in ... its still on the lighter side, but at least ok for now. yeah t sound not enugh with the 3 coasters, but you can do a lot with them, its not tha conplex building like planet coaster - but its so much fun, i mean cannons? Off rail parts? nice.

Yeah, its a great Game, finaly something different and something that can appeal for the creative folks and the management lovers. Rly good balanced out in that regard. So yeah. Great Game. will be even beter if patched good";0.21238095238095236

it is something different than planet coaster, and therefore interesting. impossifications are awesome.

what you can/should improve:
-first person mode/cam
-the paths to edit is still partly terrible
-sometimes objects can not be moved to another place
-sometimes the visitors don't use the coasters ( they just stand in front of the entrance)

It is not worth the price point for it to be this buggy. One or two bugs would have been fine, but this is a lot. Camera bugs out, can't move objects after placing, visual glitches with every little thing, long queues at rides but the ride doesn't go. Also in the campaign I find it kind of ridiculous I have to place rides/shops on top of plateaus when I can't even change the landscape. So then you have to place the paths a specific way, some hanging sideways off the cliff, just in order for me to complete the quest. Not at all realistic and looks tacky since I'm trying to make my park look nice but then you see this mile long path up a hill. Anyway, at its current state, not recommending especially for the price. Get it only if you don't care about bugs.  

Original post: I'll start by saying I have not played Planet Coaster and that's for two reasons. Planet Coaster is more for building rides and less of customer satisfaction, and I played Planet Zoo and immediately disliked it (I knew it was very similar on how planet coaster played).

That being said, I already like this game due to the fact that I am building an amusement park based off how happy my customers are. That is the primary goal, and something I am looking for in a game. If anyone remembers Thrillville, this is exactly that. You can still customize a lot in the world; building a coaster based off how ""thrilling"" it's going to be, changing the color of buildings, putting trees or plants down, selecting a theme etc. (looks like you can customize the outside of buildings but haven't gotten that far yet so not sure). You'll be disappointed if you're comparing it to planet coaster though because it's not as customizable as Planet Coaster, and of course the graphics are more cartoonish. I only played through one campaign, and yes, there is a sandbox mode to play around with that you could probably spend hours in.

As far as performance on the PC, the opening cut scene was lag city for me. As soon as that went away, it was fine. It runs smoothly in the parks and other scenes. I do see some graphic design flaws though. Placing certain objects next to each other don't look good, such as vending machines, or if you place a buildings or paths too close to things, it merges together. Looks pretty ridiculous. I also placed a ride but decided I wanted to move it and holy moly, it completely messed up on my screen. It was like half stuck in the ground and I couldn't get it back so I can have the entrance again. Thankfully there is an undo button and that fixed the problem. Haven't run into anything else. 

 Even with the little I've played, I still recommend it if you're looking for more of a customer management game!";0.07385741652983031

Now that I've played 6+ hours here's an update of what i think:

1) I still recommend it as an alternative to Planet Coaster... but...
2) the game feels unfinished, so many things are wrong, basic things like unable to update a path texture or fence rails after setting a path down - you have to delete the path and do it all over
3) building custom structures is so tedious and un-intuitive, things don't snap in place, there's like one useful ""door"" and it never snaps to the ground.  
4) It's nearly impossible to create a cattle pen queue
5) there are no ""arches"" available (at the beginning - must unlock) = okay not a bit deal but would be nice to start with a few more items
6) there are no wooden walls
7) very limited roofs
8) basically there's no point in building anything
9) there are no rollercoaster support beams and when you create a path it removes the coaster beam and you're left with a portion just floating there - it should at the very least have a way to reset that beam as you go or have some for you in extra parts to add
10) It's A bit cartoony.  
11) no way to bind keys


I still recommend it.  Again, it's waaaaaaaaaay different than Planet Coaster and Parkitect or RCT series.  Honestly with amount of time spent on the development and the beta period I'm rather apalled by the lack of details and polish to basic stuff.";0.016455026455026455

This is not Park Beyond. Yet. 

If you take out all park management, customer interactions and making money and focus just on creating a beautiful theme park - Park Beyond is excellent. I love the art style of the game and I really love how creative you can get with coasters and how your park looks. However, once you've built this super fabulous theme park. What now? You can't manage it because.

-	Your coasters never have customers and always work at a loss.
-	Your coasters randomly just get stuck for no reason and there's just no fixing it and whilst stuck, there's a line of customers doing nothing when they could be walking the rest of your park spending money. 
-	Your staff are useless and overpaid, even at the lowest cost.
-	The only way to keep customers in the park and happy is to basically place a water and food shop every 3 tiles.
-	Customers don't want to pay much for entrance and because there are three groups of customers and you can't set a price for each group, you're left with pissing off some customers with high prices whilst the other two groups say it's a bargain! 
There's a whole list of reasons as to why park management in Park Beyond makes the game unplayable from this aspect and diminishes any sense of achievement and quickly takes away that dopamine hit and makes you realise you've been playing a game, meticulously designing areas of your park for 6 hours for absolutely nothing once you open the gates. 
For people looking to buy this game, I'd say wait. Wait until around a year after release when the developers have finished building the base game. What has been released is a beta, a beta that we've been charged to play. I understand the business reason as to why It was released like this (recoup costs quickly and assess market desire to play) but it wouldn't have been such a negative experience had they had released the game as an early access at a lower cost, gathered feedback, made changes and then released as a full game and began roll out of new themes, mods, in-game purchase of ride skins or whatever they can come up with to take the money I'd have DEFINITELY given them had the game have been what I'd expect. 

I'll continue to log into the game an hour or so a week to keep my park looking nice and keep adding, in the hopes that one day in 2028 I'll be able to then manage it and see a return on investment.

The game feels familiar, but the mechanics have been simplified. There is an in-game option to rotate and position items with a precision tool if you desire more complex builds.

Most, if not all, rides have a unique twist to them, which I personally appreciate. They are very over the top, deserving a solid 10/10 rating.

Making paths sometimes feels a bit clumsy, and the lack of Steam Workshop is disappointing. However, the controls and the coaster construction mechanics are phenomenal. Occasionally, the face of an NPC clips through the screen while riding the coaster, which can be quite startling. I'm confident that this issue will be addressed in future updates.

Overall, I highly recommend Park Beyond. I'm eagerly looking forward to what they bring to the table with the upcoming 3 DLCs.

I also believe the price is fair. While there are a few bugs, this studio has already released three enormous patches within the first three weeks of the game's release, which shows their dedication. Furthermore, when you consider that Planet Coaster, a comparable game, is still priced at 40 euros (not on sale) even after its 2016 release, Park Beyond offers excellent value for the money.

This game has tremendous potential, and I'm excited to see what it brings in the near future.";0.07336257309941523

i would wait to purchase until the devs can sort out the stability issues, if they do it will be a much better gaming experiance.

with regards game stability and is now 100% better than when i posted my above review.

It bring exactly what I wanted and that is a bridge between Roller Coaster Tycoon (RCT) and Planet Coaster (PC). You get some of the relaxed and wackiness of RCT but more in depth building of PC. Park Beyond's biggest problems for me is multiple times it seems like anytime I build something in my park my park seems to hemorrhage money. Eventually it seems to go down but it's something I've never experienced in games. I'm guessing it has something to do with upkeep and breakdowns of your rides. Which is fixable but adjusting the severity of upkeep or turning it off entirely. Park Beyond in my opinion launched with a lackluster amount of rides but it's possible that is due to me being a sandbox peasant. I also feel more restricted with decorations. Despite having 1000 items, 
I find myself running out of options that make sense for a theme. But then other themes are loaded with assets to use. I think this game would benefit greatly with a workshop added. The last problem with Park Beyond is optimization. Game launch will take you 2-5 minutes and loading your park will take another few minutes. After all that loading I get 20 FPS on my GTX 1070.

also the so call ride preferring for the guests is annoying as hell

If you played Planet Coaster or the old classics typhoon games, then you'll sure like this as it's a mix of them all. a few minor bugs and optimisation issues with the coasters, but i'm sure it will get fixed. Solid game for launch and it will only get better with the continue support from the developers.;0.1535714285714286

Way too many bugs and crashes.  I will say you have to go into this game without comparing it to Planco.  It is MILES different and it's more on par with Thrillville.  That being said though, I did refund it unfortunately and I'll get it again on a sale and/or when most of the bugs are ironed out.;0.15714285714285717

I've been having fun with the game thus far, and really enjoy some of the wackiness of the characters and rides.  Thrillville OTR was my favorite game as a kid and Park Beyond hits on some of that goofy nostalgia.  Park Beyond is not as robust or in depth of a management sim as PlanCo, but it isn't really trying to be.  Not sure if it's worth the asking price of $50 USD right now, but I think with consistent updates, it could be.  Overall, I'm glad I picked it up, if only for the dose of nostalgia.

EDIT: As time has gone on, the bugs have become infuriating and I have had the game crash on me.  I still think the game has potential if they can fix the bugs and add more content.  Until, at least, the bugs are fixed, I'm not sure I'll be reaching for this one.

EDIT 2:  The game has been out for over a month and I am somehow encountering even more bugs than I did at launch.  If I could refund this game, I would.  This is probably the most disappointing experience I've had with a game in a while.";0.00736607142857143

I've had to mark this as negative. the game is just too riddled with bugs at the moment, and despite small and tiny things getting fixed, I'm still waiting to see the first fix that changes how the game feels. 

imagine, if you bought an iphone from Apple, but apple gave you the box instead and sent you parts every few days as a way of an ""update"" so in the end you'd get your phone, but it'd just take a very very long time. 

that's how this game feels at the moment, completely unfinished, despite it being version 1.";-0.06251515151515151

From crashes and freezes to inconsistent physics and pathfinding problems, the game is riddled with frustrating moments that disrupt immersion and makes me feel extremely frustrated. It's clear that the game was rushed to release, neglecting crucial bug fixing and optimization.

There is a serious Lack of Content.... Despite the initial promises of a vast array of rides, attractions, and customization options, Park Beyond falls short in providing substantial content. The limited selection of rides and attractions quickly becomes repetitive, stifling creativity and replayability. Yes, Impossification is cool but it is simply not enough to carry the game. There is a severe lack of variety and depth, leaving me with an empty feeling unfulfilled and restricted with my creative endeavors. 

The devs offer poor support and communication to remedy issues. The developers of Park Beyond have demonstrated a lack of commitment to their player base. Issues and complaints/suggestions are ignored, leaving everyone in the dark with no resolution in sight. The lack of transparency and communication exacerbates the frustration experienced by the community, further crumbling the foundation the developers were trying to build. When on stream someone asked if there were gonna be dark rides and the developers dont even know what a darn dark ride is like cmon lmao...

In conclusion, Park Beyond fails to live up to anything. With its shallow gameplay, technical issues, frequent crashes, lack of content, and poor support, this game leaves me with a very bitter taste. Save yourself the frustration, money and avoid this game. There are far better alternatives available in this genre that offer a more satisfying and immersive experience.";-0.04371663059163058
